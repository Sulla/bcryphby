= bcryphtuby

A thin CLI wrapper around bcrypt-ruby, and then a thin PHP wrapper around that.

== Good god, why??

During transition from PHP to Ruby, I need to create new user accounts using decent password hashing that will not be regretted later.  Bcrypt rocks.  PHP doesn't.

== Why name it so badly?

It's a beautiful Ruby gem, trapped in a mediocre CLI wrapper, wrapped in horrible PHP.
It deserves a bad name.

== Doesn't PHP already support bcrypt?

The short answer is no.
The long answer involves version numbers and unofficial "security" patches.
The medium answer is not on my transitional production environment.

== How's it looking?

I haven't written it yet.  More news as it happens.

== Meh.
